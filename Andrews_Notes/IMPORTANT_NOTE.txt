USE A GAME MANAGER FOR PLAYER INPUT, AND SEPARATE THE PLAYER MOVEMENT TO THE ACTUAL GAME OBJECTS.
THIS WAY, THERE WON'T BE MULTIPLE SCRIPTS FOR REGISTERING INPUT ON EACH SQUAD MEMBER.
THE GAME MANAGER WILL READ FOR THE USER INPUT FOR GENERAL PURPOSE ACTIONS LIKE AN OPTIONS MENU.
maybe not the game manager, but make an input manager that deals with input.
a separate class which the entire purpose is to just read the player input, then get the functionality from other code.
