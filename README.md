# Spires
A game about towers and shiet. In all seriousness, it's an alien "invasion" ARPG. The aliens' flesh is metallic and conventional weapons don't do a lot of damage to them. These aliens came from spires that fell from the sky (not necessarily from space, could be from another dimension if we want to get wacky). Around the impact sites of the spires, a strange form of matter as spread from them akin to starcraft creep. The aliens have adapted based on their environments, so ones in desert sands have become heat resistant and some may have taken the form of sand sharks for instance. The goal of the player and the player's team as an expendable group of recruits is to go in and research the threat, if at all possible.

IMPORTANT: I (Andrew) tend to slap stuff down either in a .txt document or inside the scripts if I get an idea about something. I'll try to avoid that but there's a reason why there's a folder called Andrew's notes.

Anyway, I'm going to be using certain terminology in some of the comments, and I'll define them here. But before I do, I'll point out that there's no wiki. I don't have a premium github account so we'll have to make do with this readme or some sort of in-project documentation.

PC = Player Character (Or player controlled character).

NPSM = Non-Player Squad Member.

NPC = Non-Player Character (Not playable at all).

Everything in the project is organized in namespaces. The namespaces are represented by folders. For example, anything in the Spires.Core namespace will be in the core folder. It's good practice to null check at runtime, so I'd recommend making a snippet if there isn't one by default. DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER BRANCH. I REPEAT, DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER BRANCH. MAKE A NEW BRANCH OF THE PROJECT INSTEAD. WHEN YOU THINK IT'S READY TO BE COMMITTED, MAKE A PULL REQUEST. Trello coming soon.

That's all I can think of for now. I'll update the readme if I can think of anything else to put down.
